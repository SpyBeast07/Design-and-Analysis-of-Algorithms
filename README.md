# Design and Analysis of Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures developed as part of the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course.

## File Descriptions
[BFS.c](BFS.c)
An implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

[BST.c](BST.c)
Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.

[BTree.c](BTree.c)
An implementation of a B-Tree, a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

[Closest_pair_brute.c](Closest_pair_brute.c)
A brute-force approach to solve the Closest Pair of Points problem, which finds the pair of points that are closest to each other in a given set of points.

[Closest_pair_Divide&Conquer.c](Closest_pair_Divide&Conquer.c)
An implementation of the Divide and Conquer algorithm to solve the Closest Pair of Points problem more efficiently than the brute-force approach.

[DFS.c](DFS.c)
An implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

[heapSort.c](heapSort.c)
Implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm, which utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements.

[Interval_scheduling.c](Interval_scheduling.c)
An implementation of the Interval Scheduling Maximization problem, which selects the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals from a given set of intervals.

[Kruskal.c](Kruskal.c)
An implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph.

[Lab.c](Lab.c)
Contains various lab exercises and experiments related to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course.

[maxHeap.c](maxHeap.c)
Implementation of a Max-Heap, a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.

[MergeSort.c](MergeSort.c)
An implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer approach to sorting elements.

[Multiway_Search_Tree.c](Multiway_Search_Tree.c)
Implementation of a Multiway Search Tree, a generalization of a binary search tree where each node can have more than two children.

[Prims.c](Prims.c)
An implementation of Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted, undirected graph.

[PriorityQueue_assn1_array.c](PriorityQueue_assn1_array.c)
Implementation of a Priority Queue using an array data structure.

[PriorityQueue_assn1_LL.c](PriorityQueue_assn1_LL.c)
Implementation of a Priority Queue using a linked list data structure.

[PriorityQueue_assn2_heaps.c](PriorityQueue_assn2_heaps.c)
Implementation of a Priority Queue using a heap data structure.

[QuickSort.c](QuickSort.c)
An implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer approach to sorting elements that uses a pivot to partition the array.
